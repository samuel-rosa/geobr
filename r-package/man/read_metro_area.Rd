\title{Download spatial data of official metropolitan areas in Brazil}
\usage{
read_metro_area(year = 2018, simplified = TRUE, showProgress = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{A year number in YYYY format. Defaults to \code{2018}}

\item{simplified}{Logic \code{FALSE} or \code{TRUE}, indicating whether the function
returns the data set with original' resolution or a data set with 'simplified'
borders. Defaults to \code{TRUE}. For spatial analysis and statistics users should
set \code{simplified = FALSE}. Borders have been simplified by removing vertices of
borders using \code{sf::st_simplify()} preserving topology with a \code{dTolerance} of 100.}

\item{showProgress}{Logical. Defaults to \code{TRUE} display progress bar}
}
\value{
An \verb{"sf" "data.frame"} object
}
\description{
The function returns the shapes of municipalities grouped by their respective metro areas.
Metropolitan areas are created by each state in Brazil. The data set includes the municipalities that belong to
all metropolitan areas in the country according to state legislation in each year. Orignal data were generated
by Institute of Geography. Data at scale 1:250,000, using Geodetic reference system "SIRGAS2000" and CRS(4674).
