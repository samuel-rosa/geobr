-------------------------------------------------------
# geobr v1.5

### New data sets/functions

(added in 2021-01).

### Minor changes

-------------------------------------------------------
# geobr v1.4


### New data sets/functions
* data set `read_health_region` to read the health regions - closes issue #149 (added in 2020-07).
* updated 2019 data sets of `intermediate`, `immediate` `micro` and `meso` regions, `states` and `municipalities`.

### Minor changes
* improved documentation of argument `simplified`
* included documentation of argument `zone` in the `read_census_tract` function
* `read_municipality()` function now also takes additional inputs for data sets before 1992. Closes issue #163 (added in 2020-06)
* harmonized the `st_geometry_type()` of data sets to `MULTIPOLYGON`, when appropriate. Closes issues #41 #151  #135 #172
* fix typo in `geobr::grid_state_correspondence_table`. Closes #187
* argument `tp` fully deprecated and replaced with `simplified`. No more warning message
* sample data with life expectancy of Brazilian states in 2017. To be used in vignette

-------------------------------------------------------
# geobr v1.3 (2020-03-30)

### New data sets/functions
* data set `read_neighborhood` to read neighborhood limits of Brazilian municipalities - closes issue #104 (added in 2020-03).

### Major changes
* New argument `showProgress` to display progress bar. Defaults to `TRUE`
* Argument `tp` was deprecated and replaced by argument `simplified` that needs to be either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. This should only affect user who have previously used `tp=TRUE`, who now should write `simplified=FALSE`

### Minor changes

* reorganization of internal support functions to reduce code redundancy
* substantial improvment in test coverage of functions
* substantial improvment in test coverage of functions
* modified package tests using new format of `crs` objects. Following `sf` package update `v0.9-0`



-------------------------------------------------------
# geobr v1.2 (2020-02-20)

### New data sets/functions
* data set `read_metro_area` to read official metropolitan areas - closes issue #2 (added in 2019-12).
* data set `read_municipal_seat` to read the spatial coordinates of municipal seats- closes issue #86 (added in 2019-12).
* function `lookup_muni` to look up municipality codes by their name, or the other way around. closes issue #58 (added in 2019-12)
* function `list_geobr` to list all the datasets available in geobr - Closes issue #57.
  
### Major changes
* MAJOR change of `geobr` to read `geopackage` files, instead of `.rds`. A structural change that will make it easier to maintain both versions of geobr in R and Python  (2020-02)
* All functions now have an additional argument `tp` as in data 'type'. This argument defaults to read data sets with 'simplified' borders, what makes the package much more efficient for downloading and plotting the data. Closes issue #76 (2020-02)
* Pretty much all functions now download the data for the entire country as a default. Closes issue #77. The only exceptions are `read_statistical_grid` and `read_census_tract`. These two functions do take a really long time to load the data for the whole country and it might crash R due to memory limits, so the user must be more 'aware' about her choice (2020-02)

### Minor changes
 * New utils.R script containing support functions to reduce code redundancy (2020-02)




-------------------------------------------------------
# geobr v1.1 (2019-12-03)

* data set `read_amazon` to read official data of Brazil's Legal Amazon - closes issue #38 (added in 2019-10-07).
* data set `read_conservation_units` to read official data of Environmental Conservation Units - closes issue #59 (added in 2019-10-08).
* data set `read_urban_area` to read official data of urban footprint of Brazilian cities - closes issue #52 (added in 2019-10-17).
* data set of biomes (2019) available at scale 1:250.000. (added in 2019-10-31) - closes issue #72
* data set of `read_intermediate_region` (2017) (added in 2019-11-28)
